ENGGEN 131 Project for C
========================

This was the second project for the course. Unlike the [MATLAB project](https://github.com/ErnWong/greedywalk) earlier, there isn't an overall theme that unites all ten tasks for the project. The descriptions of each task can be found in the corresponding comments above each function inside the main source file - `project.c`.

The final bonus tasks are to count the number of gold cells (represented by the number 9) in each region of gold within a mining map (represented by a 2d array).
